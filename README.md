# SIE for Visual Studio Code
The SIE extension adds language support for [SIE](https://sie.se/in-english/) (type 1-4) to Visual Studio Code.

## Background
SIE is the standard file format for Swedish accounting data.

SIE 5 is the latest version of the file format, but since it's currently not supported by most bookeeping software, it's not covered by this extension.
(It's suppsed to be just XML anyway.)

## Overview
The primary focus of this extension is to provide proper settings and syntax highlighting for SIE 4.

SIE files (with extensions `*.sie`, `*.si`, and `*.se`) will be opened and saved with the correct encoding (CP437).

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome.
